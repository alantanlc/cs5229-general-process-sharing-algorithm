Consider the following packet arrivals from three connections A,B and C. The link speed is 3 bits/sec. Scheduling is done using FQ. Find the Finish Numbers (FN) and departure times of the first 2 packets and the last 2 packets that departs. (Comment: You should consider writing a small program to find (all) the answers rather than finding the answers manually. You do not have to submit the program.)

Packet		A1	C1	B1	C2	A2	B2	C3	C4	B3	C5
Time(s)		1	2	3	4	5	6	6	8	9	10
Size(bits)	10	2	6	2	10	6	2	2	6	2
